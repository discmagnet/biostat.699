### Description

Some patients with cancers of the blood are receiving an alloHSCT from a genetically-matched donor because other forms of treatment are not working. Among those who receive an alloHSCT, 40-50% experience an immune reaction called acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). GVHD occurs when the T-cells of the graft fight the remaining immune system of the host, and it is classified as *acute* if it occurs within 100 days. We know that this type of treatment alters the intestinal microbiome, so we hope that treatments that maintain health in the intestine reduce the incidence of aGVHD. One potential treatment is an increased consumption of potato starch. It was our job to design a one-arm clinical trial in which all participants ingest 40g of starch everyday for up to 100 days. We determined the sample size needed to detect a reduction of the 50% historical rate of aGVHD to each of 40%, 35%, and 30% with 80% power and 5% type I error. The power analysis and sample size calculations were repeated after accounting for competing risks and patient noncompliance.
