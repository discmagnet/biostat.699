## Project 1

### Description

With an aging population, it is becoming increasingly important for car companies to keep the interests of the elderly in mind. Along with age comes a degradation in sensorimotor function, and tasks that are considered trivial by much of the general population are actually difficult for some of the elderly. One task in particular is simply getting into and out of a vehicle. In an effort to better understand the factors that go into ingress/egress performance, a study was conducted on 48 older community-dwelling drivers with varying degrees of sensorimotor dysfunction. The study specifically set out to determine (1) if ingress/egress strategy had an effect on driver ingress/egress time in the elderly, (2) if mobility impairments affected performance, and (3) which human capacities best explain the variation in ingress/egress time between drivers.

## Project 2

### Description

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a type of non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma that affects B-lymphocyte white blood cells, which are responsible for secreting antibodies to keep the body from getting infected. The disease is not known to be curable, but it progresses very slowly. Patients can be diagnosed with FL and live many years, even decades, before the disease advances to a more serious stage. However, patients with FL can have their disease transform to Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), which is much more aggressive. In an effort to better understand how treatments are affecting FL patients in Michigan, a study was conducted with the Hematological Malignancies Cancer Research (HemeCaRe) Database on 418 patients with FL. The study specifically set out to compare the overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) between patients who were treated with Rituximab & Bendamustine (R&B) and patients who were treated with some other form of treatment. In addition, the study also set out to analyze the incidence of transformation of FL to DLBCL and determine if treatment plays a role in the progression to DLBCL.

## Project 3

### Description

Starting in 2013, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) came together to conduct the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study. It was a longitudinal study that reached people across the entire United States with the hope that we can better understand tobacco use behaviors and how its use affects health over time. In particular, we wanted to determine whether menthol cigarettes and/or flavored electronic cigarettes make a smoker more or less likely to quit cigarette smoking altogether. In addition, we wanted to determine if there are differential effects by population subgroups, such as gender, age, race, education, income, or region, from a health disparities perspective.

## Project 4

### Description

Some patients with cancers of the blood are receiving an alloHSCT from a genetically-matched donor because other forms of treatment are not working. Among those who receive an alloHSCT, 40-50% experience an immune reaction called acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), which is one of the leading causes of early death in HSCT recipients. GVHD occurs when the T-cells of the graft fight the remaining immune system of the host, and it is classified as *acute* if it occurs within 100 days. Unfortunately, there are few approaches to prevent or treat aGVHD. We know that this type of treatment alters the intestinal microbiome, so we hope that treatments that maintain health in the intestine reduce the incidence of aGVHD. One potential treatment is an increased consumption of potato starch. It was our job to design a one-arm clinical trial in which all participants ingest 40g of starch everyday for up to 100 days. We determined the sample size needed to detect a reduction of the 50% historical rate of aGVHD to each of 40%, 35%, and 30% with 80% power and 5% type I error. The power analysis and sample size calculations were repeated after accounting for competing risks and patient noncompliance.
