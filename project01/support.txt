DATASET 1

Subject: identifier (S##)
Gender: M=male, F=female
Age: continuous variable in years
Group: categorical variable (OA (osteoarthritis), PN (diabetic peripheral neuropathy), Control)
MDNS: Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score (notice those with PN generally had higher scores)
Foot: categorical variable (Right, Left)
Hand: categorical variable (Right, Left, Both)
TUG: Timed Up and Go; subject stands up from a chair, walks a 3m distance, circles around a cone on the floor, and comes back to the chair and sits down; duration measured in seconds; minimum time taken out of two attempts
mTUG: Number of missing measurements
OLB_R: One Leg Balance Time with Right Foot; duration measured in seconds (up to 30); maximum time taken out of three attempts
mOLB_R: Number of missing measurements
OLB_L: One Leg Balance Time with Left Foot; duration measured in seconds (up to 30); maximum time taken out of three attempts
mOLB_L: Number of missing measurements
GripR: Maximum isometric grip strength with Right hand
mGripR: Number of missing measurements
GripL: Maximum isometric grip strength with Left hand
mGripL: Number of missing measurements
MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination test used to measure cognitive impairment; 30 is a perfect score indicating no cognitive impairments
TrailsB: Trails making test B; the subject connects a set of 25 dots, alternating between numbers and letters, as fast as possible while still maintaining accuracy; duration measured in seconds
KneeExt: Maximum isometric knee extension strength; only left knee strength was measured at 90 degree flexion angle; reported as a torque in N*m
mKnee: Number of missing measurements
HipABd: Maximum isometric hip abduction strength; only left hip abduction strength was measured at 0 degree abduction angle; reported as a torque in N*m
mHipABd: Number of missing measurements
HipRTD: Maximum hip abduction rate of torque development; only left hip RTD at 0 degree abduction angle; units are N*m/s
mHipRTD: Number of missing measurements
SRT: Simple Reaction Test; average time is recorded
RRT: Recognition Reaction Test; average time of catching the stick in the trials when the light came on (in milliseconds)
Accuracy: The percentage of times the subject caught/let the stick drop correctly
OffAccuracy: The percentage of time the subject let the stick drop when the lights were off

NOTES:
- Since we already have information about foot size, I decided to completely remove the shoe size variable, as it was very hard to work with. There were Men's and Women's sizes, but some women wore Men's shoes, and one person had two different sizes.
- I am not too worried about the missing values for the OLB measurements. I am interested in the maximum times, and many of those without all three measurements were those with high times. I figure that they thought they were "too good" to do it all three times.
