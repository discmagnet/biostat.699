# Background

## Follicular Lymphoma

- Type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that affects B-lymphocyte white blood cells, which are responsible for secreting antibodies

- Not known to be curable, but progresses slowly

- Can transform to Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)

## Overview of Dataset

- 418 individuals with Follicular Lymphoma (FL)
- Many variables to consider:
    
    - Demographics
    - Key dates (birth, death, diagnosis, last contact, etc.)
    - Additional diagnosis/disease specifics (e.g. stage of disease)
    - Lab measurements upon entering treatment at Michigan
    - Treatment information on up to 10 treatment regimens

## Aims

  1. Compare the overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) of patients with FL.
  
      - Specifically: Compare OS and PFS between patients treated with Bendamustine + Rituximab and those with other treatments.
      
  2. What is the incidence of Transformation of FL to Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)?
  
      - Specifically: Does treatment play a role in progression to DLBCL?
      
# Aim #1

## Defining Overall and Progression Free Survival

### Overall Survival

- Time Zero defined as date of \textcolor{blue}{first official treatment}
- Observation does not count as an official treatment
- Survival time defined as time until \textcolor{blue}{death} or censoring
- Date of censoring is the later of the \textcolor{blue}{censor date} and \textcolor{blue}{last contact date}

### Progression Free Survival

- Time Zero defined the same way as OS
- Survival time defined as time until \textcolor{blue}{first progression} or censoring
- Date of censoring is the last available \textcolor{blue}{response date}

## Defining OS and PFS Continued

## Patients to Exclude from Analysis

1. Those who transformed to DLBCL before treatment at Michigan

    - no information about pre-transformative state
    - \textcolor{red}{18 patients excluded}
    
2. Those who were diagnosed away from Michigan and did not start treatment at Michigan soon after

    - an effort to deal with **left truncation**
    - only look at patients whose lab date is within 6 months of diagnosis date
    - \textcolor{red}{86 patients excluded}

## Patients to Exclude from Analysis

3. Those who did not receive a treatment and/or did not have a treatment date

    - without a date to use as time zero, there's not much we can do
    - \textcolor{red}{42 patients excluded}
    
4. Those who had a treatment date, but no treatment specified

    - \textcolor{red}{6 patients excluded}
    
5. Those under observation during the first regimen, but did not receive a treatment after

    - as useful as the people without a treatment at all
    - \textcolor{red}{78 patients excluded}

## Patients to Exclude from Analysis

## Patients to Exclude from Analysis

21 additional patients had to be excluded for the PFS analysis:

6. Those who somehow responded to treatment before actually receiving treatment

    - \textcolor{red}{2 patients excluded}
    
7. Those who did not progress, but also did not have any response dates

    - without a date to use for time until censoring, there's not much we can do
    - \textcolor{red}{19 patients excluded}

New total of 167 patients for the PFS analysis

## 5-year survival: 0.887 (0.840, 0.949)

## No Apparent Difference Between Treatments

## No Apparent Difference Between Treatments

Fit a Cox model to estimate treatment effect (unadjusted)

- Those who received the Rituximab & Bendamustine treatment have a 10% reduction in hazard of death compared to those receiving other treatments.
- Hazard Ratio: 0.897
- 95% CI: (0.335, 2.404)
    
Fit a second Cox model that adjusts for age and gender

- Reached nearly the same conclusion
- Hazard Ratio: 0.916
- 95% CI: (0.339, 2.470)

## Median survival: 0.83 years (approx. 10 months)

## No Apparent Difference Between Treatments

Fit a Cox model to estimate treatment effect (unadjusted)

- Those who received the Rituximab & Bendamustine treatment have a 20% increase in hazard of progression compared to those receiving other treatments.
- Hazard Ratio: 1.195
- 95% CI: (0.714, 2.001)
    
Fit a second Cox model that adjusts for age and gender

- Reached nearly the same conclusion
- Hazard Ratio: 1.187
- 95% CI: (0.707, 1.994)

# Aim #2

## Defining Transformation Free Survival

- Time Zero defined as date of \textcolor{blue}{first official treatment}
- Survival time defined as time until date of \textcolor{blue}{last contact} for *both* those who transform to DLBCL ($\delta = 1$) and those who do not, and are thus censored ($\delta = 0$)
- Relaxed exclusion criteria (step 2 addressing left truncation) to include more events (increasing from 27 to 47 transformations)

## 5-year survival: 0.824 (0.761, 0.892)

## No Apparent Difference Between Treatments

Fit a Cox model to estimate treatment effect (unadjusted)

- Those who received the Rituximab & Bendamustine treatment have a 2% increase in hazard of transformation compared to those receiving other treatments.
- Hazard Ratio: 1.02
- 95% CI: (0.41, 2.53)
    
Fit a second Cox model that adjusts for age and gender

- Reached nearly the same conclusion
- Hazard Ratio: 0.98
- 95% CI: (0.39, 2.44)

## Summary

- There was no apparent difference between being treated with Rituximab & Bendamustine and other treatments in any of the analyses
- Limitations:
    
    - Proportionality assumption violated
    - Not enough events to answer the given research questions
    
Open for questions...
