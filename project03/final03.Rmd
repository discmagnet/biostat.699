# Background

## Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study 

- Conducted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  between 2013 and 2016

- In an effort to better understand tobacco use behaviors and how its use affects health over time

## Overview of PATH Dataset

- Longitudinal design with 3 waves:
    
    - Wave 1: 2013-14 (32,320 participants)
    - Wave 2: 2014-15 (28,362 participants)
    - Wave 3: 2015-16 (28,148 participants)

- Sample is representative of civilian, non-institutionalized US population age 12 and older

- Some demographics were oversampled

    - Tobacco Users
    - Young Adults (18-24)
    - African Americans
    
- Survey weights were also provided to ensure representativeness

## Aims

Primary Aims

  1. Does smoking **menthol cigarettes** make a smoker less likely to quit smoking altogether?
  
      
  2. Does using **flavored electronic cigarettes** make someone more or less likely to quit cigarette smoking altogether?

Secondary Aims

  - Are there differential effects by population subgroups, from a health disparities perspective?
  - These subgroups being based on gender, age, race, education, income, and region

# Primary Aims

## Methodology

  - Even though the PATH study consists of longitunal data, we took a non-longitudinal approach
  
  - Performed logistic regression to try and predict outcomes in Waves 2 and 3 with characteristics in Wave 1
  
  - Only used subjects who participated in every wave (23,670)
  
  - Defined **smokers** as those who reported as current smokers in Wave 1 (yes or no)
  
  - Defined **menthol users** as those who reported using menthol cigarettes in Wave 1 (yes or no)
  
  - Defined **e-cigarette users** as those who reported using e-cigarettes in Wave 1 with two levels (yes-flavored, yes-unflavored, or no)

## Defining Quitting (1 of 3)

Prioritize reported **quit status** over reported **smoking status** to deal with contradictions.

1. The established smoker responds as quitting in Wave 3: \textcolor{blue}{QUITTER}
  
2. The established smoker is missing a response for quit status in Wave 3, but responds as a former smoker as of Wave 3: \textcolor{blue}{QUITTER}
  
3. The established smoker is missing a response for quit status in Wave 3, but responds as a current smoker as of Wave 3: \textcolor{red}{NOT A QUITTER}

## Defining Quitting (2 of 3)

4. The established smoker responds as not quitting in Wave 3 and responds as a current smoker as of Wave 3: \textcolor{red}{NOT A QUITTER}

5. The established smoker responds as not quitting in Wave 3, but responds as a former smoker as of Wave 3 and responds as quitting in Wave 2: \textcolor{blue}{QUITTER}

6. The established smoker responds as not quitting in Wave 3 and responds as a former smoker as of Wave 3, but responds as not quitting in Wave 2: \textcolor{red}{NOT A QUITTER}

## Defining Quitting (3 of 3)

7. The established smoker responds as not quitting in Wave 3. but responds as a former smoker as of Wave 3, has a missing response for quit status in Wave 2, and responds as a former smoker as of Wave 2: \textcolor{blue}{QUITTER}

8. The established smoker responds as not quitting in Wave 3, responds as a former smoker as of Wave 3, has a missing response for quit status in Wave 3, and responds as a current smoker as of Wave 2: \textcolor{red}{NOT A QUITTER}

9. Any other case is put as a missing value and not included in the analysis 


## Menthol Results

### Unadjusted Association

- Log odds of quitting is \textcolor{blue}{0.056 lower} for those who smoke menthol cigarettes compared to those who do not.

- 95% CI: (-0.202, 0.089) Statistically \textcolor{red}{insignificant}

### Adjusted Association

- Log odds of quitting is \textcolor{blue}{0.055 lower} for those who smoke menthol cigarettes compared to those who do not, *after adjusting for gender, age, race, education, income, and region*.

- 95% CI: (-0.230, 0.120) Statistically \textcolor{red}{insignificant}

## Flavored E-Cig Results (1 of 2)

### Unadjusted Association

- Log odds of quitting is \textcolor{blue}{0.379 higher} for those who smoke flavored e-cigarettes *compared to those who do not smoke any e-cigarettes*.

- 95% CI: (-0.664, -0.093) Statistically \textcolor{blue}{significant}

- Log odds of quitting is \textcolor{blue}{0.035 lower} for those who smoke flavored e-cigarettes *compared to those who smoke e-cigarettes without a flavor*.

- 95% CI: (-0.422, 0.492) Statistically \textcolor{red}{insignificant}

## Flavored E-Cig Results (2 of 2)

### Adjusted Association

- Log odds of quitting is \textcolor{blue}{0.222 higher} for those who smoke flavored e-cigarettes compared to those who do not smoke any e-cigarettes, *after adjusting for gender, age, race, education, income, and region*.

- 95% CI: (-0.538, 0.094) Statistically \textcolor{red}{insignificant}

- Log odds of quitting is \textcolor{blue}{0.168 lower} for those who smoke flavored e-cigarettes compared to those who smoke e-cigarettes without a flavor, *after adjusting for gender, age, race, education, income, and region*.

- 95% CI: (-0.314, 0.649) Statistically \textcolor{red}{insignificant}

# Secondary Aims

## Methodology

  - To determine if there were differential effects between subgroups, we looked at possible interactions
  
  - Fit logistic regression models that start with the adjusted model (fit previously) and adds a single interaction between the exposure of interest and subgroup characteristic of interest
  
  - Conducted likelihood ratio test to determine if the interaction term improves the fit of the model

# Summary

## Summary

- Insufficient evidence that either menthol cigarettes or flavored e-cigarettes make a smoker more or less likely to quit smoking

- Insufficient evidence there are differential effects by population subgroups
